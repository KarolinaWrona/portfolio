              My name is Karolina and I am 22 years old. I am from CzÄ™stochowa,
              but I live in Warsaw. I graduated in Microbiology from the
              University of Wroclaw. I am cat mama of 8 months old Maine Coon -
              Ginger.

              I started programming because, it was always fascinating for me
              how apps work and I wanted to build something by myself. Now I know
              that programming is what I would like to do in my life and I am
              ready to work.

              In my free time I like playing with my cat, learning new things
              and meeting with friends.
